This glossary defines key terms used throughout the SAGE Framework documentation. Use these terms consistently across all contributions.

---

## Core Terms

### SAGE
**Senior-Adaptive Guided Ecosystem**  
The name of the framework. Always written in capitals. Refers to the complete set of specifications, guidelines, and tools for creating senior-friendly digital experiences.

### Senior User
An older adult typically aged 65+, though the framework principles benefit users of all ages. The term emphasizes respect and dignity rather than limitations.

### Age-Inclusive Design
Design that considers the needs of users across all age ranges, with particular attention to the needs of senior users.

## The Four Pillars

### Safe Simplicity
**Pillar 1 of SAGE**  
The principle of reducing cognitive load without reducing functionality. Focuses on clarity, error tolerance, and essential feature preservation while eliminating unnecessary complexity.

**Key Concepts:**
- Cognitive load reduction
- Error tolerance
- Essential functionality
- Visual clarity
- Predictable behavior

### Assisted Autonomy
**Pillar 2 of SAGE**  
The principle of empowering users to make their own decisions while providing intelligent support. Balances user agency with helpful guidance.

**Key Concepts:**
- User agency
- Intelligent assistance
- Optional help
- Reversible actions
- Informed consent

### Guided Interaction
**Pillar 3 of SAGE**  
The principle of providing clear, contextual guidance throughout the user journey. Makes next steps obvious while managing complexity through progressive disclosure.

**Key Concepts:**
- Contextual guidance
- Progressive disclosure
- Clear next steps
- Orientation cues
- Path clarity

### Emotional Trust Layer
**Pillar 4 of SAGE**  
The principle of building confidence through consistent, respectful, and reassuring interactions. Creates psychological safety through familiar patterns and clear feedback.

**Key Concepts:**
- Psychological safety
- Consistency
- Familiar patterns
- Reassurance
- Feedback clarity

## Design Concepts

### Cognitive Load
The mental effort required to use an interface or complete a task. SAGE aims to minimize unnecessary cognitive load while preserving essential functionality.

### Progressive Disclosure
A design technique that presents information gradually, showing only what's needed at each step to avoid overwhelming users.

### Error Tolerance
The ability of a system to prevent errors, make errors easy to correct, and minimize the negative consequences of errors.

### User Agency
The user's ability to make independent choices and control their own experience. SAGE preserves agency while offering support.

### Contextual Guidance
Help and instructions that appear at the right time and place, relevant to what the user is currently doing.

### Reversible Actions
Operations that can be undone, allowing users to explore without fear of permanent mistakes.

### Familiar Patterns
Interface elements and behaviors that match users' existing mental models and past experiences.

## Technical Terms

### Requirement
A specific, testable specification within the SAGE Framework. Each requirement has a unique ID (e.g., S1, A3, G5, E2).

### Requirement ID
A unique identifier for each requirement, using the pillar initial followed by a number:
- **S#** - Safe Simplicity requirements
- **A#** - Assisted Autonomy requirements
- **G#** - Guided Interaction requirements
- **E#** - Emotional Trust Layer requirements

### Compliance Level
The degree to which a requirement should be met:
- **Minimum** - Essential requirement for basic SAGE compliance
- **Recommended** - Strong suggestion for improved senior-friendliness
- **Strong** - Best practice for optimal senior user experience

### Anti-Pattern
A common approach or practice that should be avoided because it works against SAGE principles.

### Metric
A quantifiable measure used to evaluate whether a requirement is met.

### Test Procedure
A defined method for verifying that a requirement has been properly implemented.

## Standards and Frameworks

### WCAG
**Web Content Accessibility Guidelines**  
W3C standards for web accessibility. SAGE complements and extends WCAG with senior-specific considerations.

### ISO 9241-210
International standard for human-centered design of interactive systems. SAGE aligns with and builds upon this standard.

### Nielsen Heuristics
Jakob Nielsen's usability heuristics for user interface design. SAGE references and extends these principles for senior users.

---

## Process Terms

### Auditable
A requirement or specification that can be objectively verified through defined testing procedures.

### Testable
A requirement that can be validated through specific, measurable tests.

### Trilingual Requirement
The mandate that all human-readable SAGE documentation must be provided in English (EN), German (DE), and Arabic (AR).

### RTL (Right-to-Left)
Text direction used in Arabic and other languages. SAGE documentation respects RTL requirements.

---

## User Experience Terms

### Touch Target
The interactive area of a button or link. SAGE requires larger touch targets for senior users.

### Contrast Ratio
The difference in luminance between text and background. SAGE requires high contrast for readability.

### Font Size
The size of text. SAGE recommends larger default font sizes for senior users.

### Response Time
How long a user has to complete an action or read a message. SAGE requires longer timeout periods.

### Confirmation
Explicit user acknowledgment before executing important or irreversible actions.

### Feedback
System response that informs users about the result of their actions.

---

## Implementation Terms

### Reference Implementation
Example code or design that demonstrates how to implement SAGE requirements.

### Checklist
A structured list of requirements organized for practical verification during design, development, or testing.

### Acceptance Test
A test that verifies whether a specific requirement has been successfully implemented.

### Pilot Implementation
An early-stage implementation used to validate SAGE specifications in real-world contexts.

---

## Governance Terms

### Core Team
Active contributors who guide the strategic direction of SAGE and approve major changes.

### Maintainer
Core Team member with repository access who manages issues, reviews contributions, and merges approved changes.

### Contributor
Anyone who contributes to SAGE through documentation, specifications, translations, examples, or other improvements.

### Consensus
Agreement reached through open discussion, the primary decision-making approach in SAGE governance.

## Related Concepts

### Digital Inclusion
The goal of ensuring all people have access to and can benefit from digital technologies.

### Universal Design
Design approach that aims to make products usable by all people to the greatest extent possible.

### Assistive Technology
Hardware or software that helps people with disabilities or age-related limitations use digital products. Examples: screen readers, magnifiers, voice control.

### Mental Model
A user's internal understanding of how something works, based on their experiences and expectations.

### Accessibility
The practice of making digital products usable by people with disabilities or limitations.
