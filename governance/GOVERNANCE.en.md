## Overview

The ELDER Framework (Empowering Living for Digitally Enhanced Responsiveness) is an open-source project dedicated to establishing standards and guidelines for creating digital experiences that empower senior users. This document outlines how the project is governed and how decisions are made.

## Mission

To provide a comprehensive, evidence-based framework that enables designers, developers, and organizations to create digital products that respect senior users' autonomy while providing appropriate support and guidance.

## Project Principles

### 1. Open and Inclusive
- All discussions and decisions are public and documented
- Anyone can contribute, regardless of background or affiliation
- We welcome diverse perspectives and experiences

### 2. Evidence-Based
- Specifications are grounded in research and real-world testing
- We prioritize measurable outcomes over assumptions
- Continuous validation with actual senior users is essential

### 3. Practical and Actionable
- Every requirement must be testable and auditable
- Specifications include clear implementation guidance
- We provide real-world examples and use cases

### 4. Trilingual by Design
- All documentation is provided in English, German, and Arabic
- This ensures global accessibility and inclusivity
- Translations maintain technical accuracy and cultural sensitivity

## Project Structure

### Core Team

The Core Team consists of active contributors who have demonstrated:
- Sustained contribution to the project
- Deep understanding of senior user needs
- Commitment to the project's principles
- Technical or domain expertise relevant to the framework

**Current Core Team Members:**
- (To be established as project grows)

**Core Team Responsibilities:**
- Review and approve pull requests
- Guide strategic direction
- Ensure quality and consistency
- Resolve conflicts and disputes
- Manage releases

### Contributors

Anyone who contributes to the project through:
- Documentation improvements
- Specification refinements
- Translations
- Example implementations
- Issue reports and discussions
- Research and evidence

All contributors are recognized and valued.

### Maintainers

Maintainers are Core Team members with repository access who:
- Merge approved pull requests
- Manage issues and discussions
- Tag releases
- Enforce Code of Conduct
- Coordinate with external organizations

## Decision-Making Process

### Consensus-Based

We strive for consensus on all decisions. The process:

1. **Proposal**: Anyone can propose changes via issues or pull requests
2. **Discussion**: Open discussion period (minimum 7 days for major changes)
3. **Feedback**: Community provides feedback and suggestions
4. **Revision**: Proposer addresses feedback
5. **Consensus**: Core Team determines if consensus is reached
6. **Implementation**: Approved changes are merged

### Major vs. Minor Decisions

**Major Decisions** (require Core Team consensus):
- Changes to framework pillars or core principles
- Modifications to governance structure
- Addition of new pillars or major components
- Changes to trilingual requirements
- Partnership or affiliation decisions

**Minor Decisions** (can be approved by any maintainer):
- Documentation improvements
- Bug fixes
- Translation updates
- Example additions
- Checklist refinements

### Conflict Resolution

When consensus cannot be reached:

1. Extended discussion period (additional 7 days)
2. Core Team vote (simple majority)
3. If still unresolved, project founder/lead makes final decision
4. Decision rationale is documented publicly

## Contribution Process

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

Key requirements:
- All contributions must align with ELDER principles
- Documentation must be trilingual
- Specifications must be testable and auditable
- Changes must maintain backward compatibility when possible

## Quality Standards

### Documentation
- Clear, concise, and actionable
- Provided in English, German, and Arabic
- Uses consistent terminology from the glossary
- Includes examples where appropriate

### Specifications
- Every requirement has a unique ID
- Clear rationale provided
- Measurable success criteria defined
- Test procedures documented
- Anti-patterns identified

### Code (if applicable)
- Well-documented and commented
- Follows established patterns
- Includes tests
- Accessible and maintainable

## Release Process

Releases follow semantic versioning (SemVer):

- **Major (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes or new pillars
- **Minor (0.X.0)**: New features, specifications, or significant additions
- **Patch (0.0.X)**: Bug fixes, translations, minor improvements

Release process:
