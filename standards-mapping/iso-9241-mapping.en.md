## Overview

This document maps ELDER Framework requirements to ISO 9241-210:2019 "Ergonomics of human-system interaction — Part 210: Human-centred design for interactive systems." ELDER operationalizes ISO 9241-210 principles with specific, testable requirements for senior users.

## About ISO 9241-210

ISO 9241-210 defines six key principles of human-centered design:

1. **Design is based upon explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments**
2. **Users are involved throughout design and development**
3. **Design is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation**
4. **Process is iterative**
5. **Design addresses whole user experience**
6. **Design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives**

ELDER provides concrete implementation guidance for these principles specifically for senior users.

---

## Principle 1: Explicit Understanding of Users

**ISO 9241-210**: Design must be based on explicit understanding of users, their tasks, and environments.

**ELDER Implementation**:

ELDER embodies deep understanding of senior users through:

| ELDER Pillar | Addresses Senior-Specific Needs |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| **Learning-Friendly** | Age-related cognitive changes, vision decline, reduced processing speed |
| **Empowered Autonomy** | Desire for independence balanced with need for support |
| **Directed Guidance** | Need for clear orientation and reduced anxiety |
| **Emotional Trust** | Concerns about security, scams, and technology intimidation |

**Specific Requirements**:
- **S2**: Recognizes age-related vision changes requiring larger text
- **S4**: Acknowledges reduced fine motor control with larger touch targets
- **A10**: Understands need for respectful, non-patronizing communication
- **E4**: Addresses heightened security concerns with trust indicators
- **E7**: Recognizes value of human support for building confidence

**How to Apply**:
1. Conduct user research with actual seniors (65+)
2. Document age-specific needs and challenges
3. Map ELDER requirements to identified needs
4. Validate designs with senior users throughout process

---

## Principle 2: User Involvement

**ISO 9241-210**: Users should be involved throughout design and development.

**ELDER Implementation**:

Every ELDER requirement includes user testing procedures involving senior users:

**Testing Requirements**:
- **S1**: "User testing: Ask 10 senior users to identify primary action"
- **A2**: "Test with users of varying skill levels"
- **G1**: "Users accurately state current position 95%+ of time"
- **E9**: "Test celebration appropriateness with senior users"

**Recommended Involvement Points**:

| Phase | Senior User Involvement | ELDER Guidance |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Research** | Contextual inquiry, interviews | Understand mental models, pain points |
| **Design** | Wireframe testing, cognitive walkthroughs | S1-S10 compliance testing |
| **Development** | Prototype testing, usability studies | A1-A10, G1-G10 validation |
| **Testing** | Acceptance testing, accessibility audit | E1-E10 perception testing |
| **Post-Launch** | Feedback collection, analytics review | Continuous refinement |

**How to Apply**:
1. Recruit diverse senior participants (age, tech proficiency, abilities)
2. Test in realistic environments (home, community centers)
3. Use ELDER test procedures as minimum baseline
4. Document findings and iterations

---

## Principle 3: User-Centered Evaluation

**ISO 9241-210**: Design must be driven and refined by user-centered evaluation.

**ELDER Implementation**:

Every ELDER requirement includes specific metrics and test procedures:

**Example Evaluation Criteria**:

| ELDER Req | Metric Type | Evaluation Method |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **S3** | Objective | Contrast ratio measurement tools |
| **S5** | Behavioral | Primary action identification rate (>90%) |
| **A3** | Behavioral | Undo success rate (95%+) |
| **G2** | Time-based | Time-to-identify next action (<3s) |
| **E3** | Subjective | Tone warmth rating (4/5+) |

**ELDER Evaluation Framework**:

1. **Automated Testing**: Contrast, font sizes, touch targets
2. **Heuristic Evaluation**: ELDER compliance audit
3. **Usability Testing**: Task completion with seniors
4. **Cognitive Assessment**: NASA-TLX or similar
5. **Emotional Response**: Trust, confidence surveys
6. **Performance Metrics**: Speed, error rates, completion rates

**How to Apply**:
1. Use ELDER metrics as evaluation baseline
2. Test early and often with senior users
3. Combine objective and subjective measures
4. Iterate based on evaluation findings
5. Document compliance against ELDER requirements

---

## Principle 4: Iterative Process

**ISO 9241-210**: Design process should be iterative.

**ELDER Implementation**:

ELDER supports iteration through:

**Built-in Iteration Points**:
- **A2: Progressive Assistance**: System adapts based on user behavior
- **A8: Safe Exploration**: Users can try without commitment
- **G8: Forgiving Navigation**: Easy to go back and revise
- **E8: Graceful Performance**: Monitoring enables continuous improvement

**Iteration Framework**:

```
1. Implement ELDER Minimum requirements
   ↓
2. Test with senior users
   ↓
3. Identify pain points and confusion
   ↓
4. Refine against ELDER Recommended requirements
   ↓
5. Re-test and validate improvements
   ↓
6. Pursue ELDER Strong requirements
   ↓
7. Continuous monitoring and refinement
```

**Metrics to Drive Iteration**:
- Task completion rates
- Time-on-task
- Error rates and types
- Support request patterns
- User satisfaction scores
- Abandonment rates

**How to Apply**:
1. Start with Minimum compliance level
2. Test and gather feedback
3. Prioritize improvements based on user impact
4. Progress to Recommended and Strong levels
5. Continuously refine based on uELDER data

**How to Apply**:
1. Map complete user journey
2. Apply relevant ELDER requirements to each touchpoint
3. Consider emotional and psychological aspects, not just functional
4. Test entire experience end-to-end
5. Address gaps in experience coverage

---

## Principle 6: Multidisciplinary Team

**ISO 9241-210**: Design team should include multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.

**ELDER Implementation**:

ELDER requires collaboration across disciplines:

**Required Perspectives**:

| Role | ELDER Contribution |
|------|------------------|
| **UX Designers** | S1-S10, G1-G10 visual and interaction design |

## Conclusion

ISO 9241-210 provides the philosophy and principles of human-centered design. ELDER provides the concrete, testable requirements and procedures to implement those principles specifically for senior users.

**Using Both Together**:
1. Adopt ISO 9241-210 process principles
2. Use ELDER requirements as implementation guidelines
3. Document both ISO process compliance and ELDER requirement compliance
4. Involve senior users throughout per both frameworks

**Key Insight**: ISO 9241-210 tells you *how to design* (process), ELDER tells you *what to design* (requirements) for senior users.
